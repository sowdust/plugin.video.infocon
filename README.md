# InfoCon.org unofficial Kodi plugin

As of now, only .mp4 and .avi files are considered.
If there are any more video extensions that should be added, please let me know.

If a subtitle file with the same name as the video file is present on the server, subtitles are automatically set.

If the playback of a video doesn't work the first time, don't give up; try again a couple of times and you might be successful.
